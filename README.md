## Gemini native ads
To see best practices for integrating native ads into your app, look through the following classes:

- [AdManager](YodelSample/Helpers/AdManager.m): This class manages ads coming from the Flurry SDK and ensures
that they are prepared and ready in advance of when they are needed.
- [CardTableViewController](YodelSample/ViewControllers/CardTableViewController.m):
This class shows how native ads can be interspersed seamlessly into a table view.
